# Discordbots

## Overview

This is a playground to learn writing *Bots* for Discord [https://discord.com] communication platform in Python. Discord bots are programs that react on certain events or commands in Discord channels they are assigned to.

## BetaBot

The *BetaBot* is the first attempt, which was intended to be hosted for free on Heroku [https://heroku.com]. It has not more than a basic 'Hello world' command. But since a bot should be running 24/7, this conflicted with the free Heroku hosting plan. I tried to work around this by shutting the bot down automatically e.g. at night, but I could not make it wake up again.

## SundayBot

This one is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi [https://www.raspberrypi.org/]. Hence, its focus is more on the Discord APIs [https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference] then on the hosting.
